                    Congrats! Time to start learning how to play. You can start by learning scales and beginner songs, but most people probably won't find that
                    very entertaining.
                    <br>
                    I think the best way to start learning is to pick one of your favorite songs (that isn't too complicated) and look for a youtube tutorial on
                    how to play it. With time, this will teach you the most common chords and strumming patterns. Good luck!

                    Cheap patch cables can introduce hum into your signal, but there's no need to buy the most expensive Fender cables. Anything above $20 will probably do. 
                    To reduce noise it's best to buy cables that are as short as possible. I find 10ft to be a good length if you're not playing on stage.

                    Buying a used guitar can be a great way to save money, but it's more important to know what you're looking for. Getting a cheap no-name beginner guitar is probably not a good idea if you plan on using it for longer. 
                    They often have very low quality pickups and use cheap materials overall. It's likely something will break within the first month of using it, and the cost of getting it fixed can be quite high.
                    <br>
                    Music stores often sell used gear. They may not offer the best deals on them, but you get the guarantee that it works.

                <p>
                    You don't need to immediately buy expensive pedals. Amps usually have an overdrive switch and some even have built-in reverb or other effects. However, you can expect to soon want to start using pedals, so you can 
                    turn effects on/off during a song. 
                    <br>
                    You can buy pedals new, but you'll be fine buying used in my experience, if the seller can show the pedal works. 
                    <br>

                A cheap guitar can sound great through a good amp, but an expensive guitar won't sound good through a cheap amp. It still isn't a good idea to buy
                the cheapest guitar you find, because it won't feel great to play and it's likely to break more quickly.
                <br>
                Buying an amp used will save you a lot of money. Some even have built-in effects like reverb or overdrive, but effects pedals will
                usually sound much better, so don't choose your first amp based on that.
