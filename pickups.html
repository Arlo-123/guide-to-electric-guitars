                    <h2>Single Pickups</h2>
                    <p>
                        Single pickups were the first pickup to be invented. They have a bright and clear sound, but are known for producing a lot of hum with higher gain.

                    <h2>Humbuckers</h2>
                    <p>
                        Humbuckers were made to do "buck the hum" that single coils produced. This made them great for anything that involves distortion and high gain.
                        They sound warmer and rounder than single pickups.
                    </p>

                <div id="p90s">
                    <h2>P90s</h2>
                    <p>
                        P90s are closer in sound to a humbucker than a singel coil, but they can be described as somewhat of an inbetween. They sound very balanced, but also produce
                        a lot of hum with higher gain.
