                        The Stratocaster is probably what most people have in mind when they think of an electric guitar. A lot of people choose this as their
                        first guitar because of its versatility.
                        <br>
                        Strats come in many different pickup configurations: SSS, HSS, HH, or HSH. The HSS Strat is the most versatile out of these four options.
                        It gives freedom to experiment, without having to know exactly what kind of music you want to play. The humbucker in the bridge is great
                        for distortion, and the two single pickups can be used for solos or leads.
                        <br>
                        The SSS Strat is the most traditional kind of Stratocaster, and it's still widely used today. It's perfect for classic rock, funk and 
                        many other genres.
                        <br>
                        HH Strats are made mostly for rock music and distortion. HSH isn't as common, but can be used for the same purpose. The single coil in the middle position usually isn't very useful.

                        The Telecaster was made primarily for country music. However, lots of people use it for completely different genres.
                        Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood famously uses his modified Fender Tele, and Kurt Cobain played the "Courtney-Tele" on stage for 
                        Nirvana's Pacific Rim Tour. 
                        <br>
                        Traditionally, Telecasters have two single-coil pickups and a 3-way selector switch, giving you the option to use
                        the neck or bridge pickup, or both at the same time. 
                        <br>
                        The bridge pickup is mounted to the metal bridge plate. This gives it a uniquely bright sound and the ability to handle distortion well.
                        Some people find it can sound too bright and shrill. You can control this by turning down the tone knob.
                        <br>
                        The neck pickup is a "lipstick-pickup". It's a standard single coil covered with metal. For the most part, it sounds like a single coil,
                        just a bit more clear and jangly.
                    </p>

                                as dark and full as, say a Les Paul)

                        The Les Paul is one of the less versatile guitars mentioned here. It usually has two humbuckers, one in the bridge and one in the neck
                        position. 
                        <br>
                        It's known for its warm and full sound. It's very good at handling distortion. Overall, the Les Paul is very good at what it was made to do:
                        rock and metal music. You won't get it to sound as clear and bright as a Tele or Strat, but it has a very unique tone of its own.

                        It's harder to find (semi-)hollow electric guitars on a small beginner budget. They can be basically any kind of guitar, a Tele, Strat,
                        or Les Paul. 
                        <br>
                        They give you a warmer and more resonant sound, great for strumming chords. They're also lighter than a solid body guitar.
                        <br>
                        When playing with a lot of distortion and high gain, they can have feedback issues. They can still be used for any kind of music, although they're most popular with jazz players.

                        A Fender Jaguar. They typically only have two single coils or humbuckers. 
                        <br><br>
                        Played by Kurt Cobain & John Frusciante

                    <p>
                        The Jaguar and Mustang both have a shorter scale length of 24" instead of the regular 25.5". This can make them easier to play, and
                        a great choice for beginners or people with small hands. Aside from reducing big stretches across the fretboard, the shorter neck also
                        lessens tension on the strings, making them easier to bend. It gives the guitar a slightly warmer tone.
                        <br>
                        Fender sells them with either two single coils, or two humbuckers.
                        <br>
                        Kurt Cobain was known for playing Jaguars and Mustangs, and Fender even created the "Jagstang" (a combination of the two) just for him.
                        <br><br>
                        The Jazzmaster has a regular scale length. It was, as you could guess, made for playing Jazz. It's also widely used for other genres,
                        like surf rock or even metal.
                        <br>
                        It comes with two humbuckers or single coils.
